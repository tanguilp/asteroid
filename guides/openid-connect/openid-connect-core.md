## ID tokens

Returned ID tokens are necessarily signed. They are signed with one of the stored keys matching
the `"id_token_signed_response_alg"` client attribute.

They can optionally be encrypted. Asteroid uses the `"id_token_encrypted_response_alg"` and
`"id_token_encrypted_response_enc"` client attributes to determine if the ID token should be
encrypted, and with which algorithms. In this case, Asteroid looks for a suitable key in the
client JWKs.

The following configuration options whitelists the acceptable algorithms:
- [`:oidc_id_token_signing_alg_values_supported`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_id_token_signing_alg_values_supported)
- [`:oidc_id_token_encryption_alg_values_supported`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_id_token_encryption_alg_values_supported)
- [`:oidc_id_token_encryption_enc_values_supported`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_id_token_encryption_enc_values_supported)

The values of these configuration options are used:
- to restrict client registration to whitelisted algorithms
- to advertise them on the `.well-known/*` discovery documents

It does not restrict a client's information somehow registered with other non-whitelisted values
to be used for ID token signing and encryption. If you change the whitelisted algorithms, you
might want to update the clients accordingly as well.

ID tokens include the `"c_hash"` and `"at_hash"` values when returned from the authorization
endpoint directly. `"at_hash"` is returned from the token endpoint when exchanged against an
authorization code but not upon renewal). ID token may be returned when using a refresh token,
depending on the following configuration options:
- [`:oidc_flow_authorization_code_issue_id_token_refresh`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_flow_authorization_code_issue_id_token_refresh)
- [`:oidc_flow_hybrid_issue_id_token_refresh`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_flow_hybrid_issue_id_token_refresh)

ID tokens also include the `"acr"`, `"amr"`, `"auth_time"` and `"nonce"` claims if available.

## Claims

The `claims` parameter is supported, in the sense that it is parsed and forwarded to the web
flow.

Since the specification stipulates that all claims (except `acr`), even those marked as
`"essential": true` are not really mandatory (an error should not be returned, even if a
condition is not met), Asteroid won't return an error handling this parameter (except for
`"acr"`).

Asteroid distinguishes 2 types of claims:
- Technical ID token claims:
  - `"iss"`,
  - `"sub"`,
  - `"aud"`,
  - `"exp"`,
  - `"iat"`,
  - `"auth_time"`,
  - `"nonce"`,
  - `"acr"`,
  - `"amr"`,
  - `"azp"`,
- subject claims: all claims not included in the list aforementioned

Subject claims are returned in the ID token or on the `/userinfo` endpoint, depending on the
`"claims"` parameter, from the subject. If the subject has no a specific claim, it is not
returned.

Technical claims are only returned in the ID Token.

## Requesting the `"acr"` Claim

The `"acr"` clain is a special case. When requesting on the `/authorize` endpoint, Asteroid
tries to determine the preferred acr for the current request. It does so by (in order):
- analyzing the `"claims"` parameter for a requested `"acr"`
- analyzing the `"acr_values"` parameter
- looking up at the `"default_acr_values"` of the client's

It then sets the `:preferred_acr` member of the request object
(`AsteroidWeb.AuthorizeController.Request`) accordingly.

It still up to the web flow to decide:
- which acr to use, as except when requested as an essential claim the OpenID Connect
specification does not make it mandatory to use the specified claim
- to reauthenticate or not depending on the `"max_age"` parameter

Back from the web flow and in the case the `"acr"` claim was requested as an essential claim,
Asteroid checks that the returned acr does indeed satisfy the requirement. If not, an error is
returned.

Note: example of an `"claims"` parameter where the `"acr"` is requested as an essential claim:

```json
{
 "id_token":
  {
   "acr": {"essential": true, "values": ["2-factor", "3-factor"]}
  }
}
```

## Web flows: implementing the authentication and authorization process

Asteroid doesn't implement the authentication and authorization web flows, which is to be
implemented by the Asteroid's developper. This process may include:
- authentication of the user thanks to login / password form, Webauthn authentication, OTP
verification, etc.
- user approval of requested scopes (authorization page)
- setting authentication cookie, for instance to make a session valid for 2 hours
- user account selection
- etc.

When calling the `/authorize` endpoint, Asteroid checks that the parameters are
correct (eg that the `"client_id"` is correct and the `"redirect_uri"` matches one of the
registered redirect URIs), handles PKCE parameters (for the authorization code flow) and checks
the OpenID Connect parameters. It also computes the preferred acr. Then it calls the
[`:web_authorization_callback`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-web_authorization_callback) which
defaults to `Asteroid.WebFlow.web_authorization_callback/2` to
further determine the callback to call.

The demo application (on the `demo_auth_workflow` git branch) offers an example of an
implementation of a web flow for OpenID Connect.

**Beware**, it's up to the developer to make sure that the flow is securely implemented. This
includes (but not limited to):
- setting the authentication cookie with the required security flags
- responding with the required security headers
- [prevent caching](https://github.com/danschultzer/pow/issues/212)
- etc.

You can refer to the
[OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.md#web-content-caching)
for more details about security issues to take into account.

This is also up to the developper to manage:
- the OpenID Connect parameters such as `"prompt"`, `"max_age"`
- current state of authentication
- the preferred ACR and which authentication schemes to use

## Userinfo endpoint

The userinfo endpoint can be reached on the `/api/oidc/userinfo` API.

The claims are returned depending on the requested claims (`"claims"` parameter) or scopes.
The following mapping shows the scope â†” claims relationship:

```elixir
%{
  "profile" => [
    "name",
    "family_name",
    "given_name",
    "middle_name",
    "nickname",
    "preferred_username",
    "profile",
    "picture",
    "website",
    "gender",
    "birthdate",
    "zoneinfo",
    "locale",
    "updated_at"
  ],
  "email" => ["email", "email_verified"],
  "address" => ["address"],
  "phone" => ["phone_number", "phone_number_verified"]
}
```

The claims are directly retrieved from the subject associated to the access token used to request
this API.

The access token is verified by the `APIacAuthBearer` plug and already set up in the configuration
files:

```elixir
config :asteroid, :api_oidc_endpoint_userinfo_plugs,
  [
    {Corsica, [origins: "*"]},
    {APIacAuthBearer,
      realm: "Asteroid",
      bearer_validator: {Asteroid.OAuth2.APIacAuthBearer.Validator, []},
      bearer_extract_methods: [:header, :body],
      forward_bearer: true,
      error_response_verbosity: :normal
    }
  ]
```

By default, the access token is looked for in the `"Authorization"` header (`GET` requests) or
in the body (`POST` requests). Note that CORS is also enabled by default. Beware of changing that
configuration: it is recommended **not** adding other authentication plugs.

Note that this API does not requires from the access token to have the `"openid"` scope, since
an access token can be requested with fewer scopes than originated.

The response can be signed and/or encrypted. Asteroid uses the following OpenID Connect client
fields to determine if a response should be encrypted or signed:
- `"userinfo_signed_response_alg"`
- `"userinfo_encrypted_response_alg"`
- `"userinfo_encrypted_response_enc"`

Encrypting without signing is possible, using the signing `"none"` algorithm. It requires
activating the `"none"` algorithm. See
[ JWS "none" algorithm ](crypto-keys.html#jws-none-algorithm).

The acceptable signature and encryption algorithms are whitelisted using the following
configuration options:
- [`:oidc_endpoint_userinfo_signature_alg_values_supported`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_endpoint_userinfo_signature_alg_values_supported)
- [`:oidc_endpoint_userinfo_encryption_alg_values_supported`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_endpoint_userinfo_encryption_alg_values_supported)
- [`:oidc_endpoint_userinfo_encryption_enc_values_supported`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_endpoint_userinfo_encryption_enc_values_supported)

The values of these configuration options are used:
- to restrict client registration to whitelisted algorithms
- to advertise them on the `.well-known/*` discovery documents

## Passing Request Parameters as JWTs

This is implemented through [JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR)](jar.html).

## Subject identifier types

The `"pairwise"` subject identifier type is supported. Refer the following configuration options:
- [`:oidc_subject_identifier_callback`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_subject_identifier_callback)
- [`:oidc_subject_identifier_pairwise_salt`](Asteroid.Config.html#module-oidc_subject_identifier_pairwise_salt)

## Offline access

When using an OpenID Connect flow, issued refresh tokens are linked to the a authenticated
session.

When this authenticated session is destroyed, be it because the last authentication event has
expired or because the authenticated session was programmatically destroyed, Asteroid destroys
associated refresh tokens that *do not have* the `"offline_access"` scope.

In a nutshell, when an authenticated session is destroyed:
- a refresh tokens issued in an OpenID Connect flow:
  - is destroyed if it contains the `"openid"` scope
    - except if it also contains the `"offline_access"` scope
- other refresh tokens are left unchanged

Offline access is enabled by adding the `"offline_access"` scope in the relevant scope
configuration option, like any other scope.
